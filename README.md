# New Relic GPT Tracker

New Relic monitoring for the Google Publishers Tag library.

## Requirements

This solution works on top of New Relic's **Browser Pro + SPA Agent**.

## Build

Install dependencies:

```
$ npm install
```

And build:

```
$ npm run build:dev
```

Or if you need a production build:

```
$ npm run build
```

## Usage

Include the scripts inside `dist` folder to your page. See `sample` folder for example.

To initialize the tracker, call method `init()` right after `enableServices()`:

```
...
googletag.enableServices()

let tracker = nrgpt.GooglePublisherTagTracker.init()
```

After having initialized the tracker, you can optionally select the targeting keys you want to be captured and sent over:

```
tracker.setTargetingKey("age")
tracker.setTargetingKey("gender")
```

If no targeting keys are selected, all are captured by default.

You can also change the visibility level to set when `SLOT_VIEWABLE` and `SLOT_HIDDEN` are triggered:

```
// Set trigger level to 10%
tracker.setVisibilityTriggerLevel(10)
```

## Data Model

### Actions

The following event names are sent by the tracker as Browser Agent `Custom Events`.

| Action Name | Description | GPT Event |
|---|---|---|
| `SLOT_REQUESTED ` | An ad has been requested for a particular slot. | *slotRequested* |
| `SLOT_RECEIVED ` | An ad response has been received for a particular slot. | *slotResponseReceived* |
| `SLOT_LOAD ` | The slot has been loaded for the first time. | *slotOnload* |
| `SLOT_RENDERED ` | The slot has been rendered for the first time. | *slotRenderEnded* |
| `SLOT_VIEWABLE` | The slot is more viewable on the user screen (default 50%, it can be changed with `setVisibilityTriggerLevel()`). | *impressionViewable*, *slotVisibilityChanged* |
| `SLOT_HIDDEN ` | The slot that previously fired a `SLOT_VIEWABLE` is no longer viewable (default less than 50%, it can be changed with `setVisibilityTriggerLevel()`). | *slotVisibilityChanged* |
